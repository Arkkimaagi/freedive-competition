# freedive-competition
Tool(s) for a freedive competition organiser

Purpose of this project is to give out a very usable tool for a freedive competition organiser, a countdown timer that could be run on simple browser without any internet connection. Hopefully people will find it useful. It is a very simple tool for now, but you never know if someone interested coder is willing to contribute and it could then evolve even better and provide more functionality.
