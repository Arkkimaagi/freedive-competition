Tool(s) for a freedive competition organiser

Purpose of this project is to give out a very usable tool for a freedive competition organiser, a countdown timer that could be run on simple browser without any internet connection. It includes countdown with visible time/audio and real time. Hopefully people will find it useful. It is a very simple tool for now, but you never know if it evolve even better and provide more functionality in future.

Anyone interested is welcome to contribute or use it.

To give it a try, do following:

1. Download the zip package and extract it

2. Open "timer.htm" in browser

3. Set the start time and interval and press "Start" -button

It is not tested in different environments, but it should work on different OS's and with firefox, chrome, IE and safari at least.
